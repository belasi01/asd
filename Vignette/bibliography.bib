abstract = {Generation of random sea surfaces using wave variance spectra and Fourier transforms is formulated in a way that guarantees conservation of wave energy and fully resolves wave height and slope variances. Monte Carlo polarized ray tracing, which accounts for multiple scattering between light rays and wave facets, is used to compute effective Mueller matrices for reflection and transmission of air-or water-incident polarized radiance. Irradiance reflec-tances computed using a Rayleigh sky radiance distribution, sea surfaces generated with Cox–Munk statistics, and unpolarized ray tracing differ by 10{\%}–18{\%} compared with values computed using elevation-and slope-resolving surfaces and polarized ray tracing. Radiance reflectance factors, as used to estimate water-leaving radiance from measured upwelling and sky radiances, are shown to depend on sky polarization, and improved values are given.
